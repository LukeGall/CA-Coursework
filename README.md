# CA-Coursework 

This repository contains the code for PartA and PartB of my CI coursework. Both parts were written in Python using the [RASA](https://rasa.com/docs/) chatbot framework.

## PartA
This part involved the creation of a weather chatbot which could answer queries on the weather location for a certain city. Users could then also ask for more weather details such as wind speed and humidity. 

## PartB
This part was an extension to the weather chatbot of PartA which involved a new 'surfing instructor' persona for the chatbot as well as exercise oriented intents such as sport suggestion, or cities to travel to. This part also add new API features such as asking for city or country facts surrounding the location the chatbot extracted from the user text.
